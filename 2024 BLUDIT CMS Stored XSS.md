## Description
In version 3.22 of Elementor Website Builder, remote attackers are allowed to directly inject XSS into areas such as Heading, Text Editor, etc., causing the exploit to be triggered even when the page is accessed.

2. Click on Templates > Saved Templates on the left side.
3. Click ADD NEW TEMPLATE.
4. Select any Type and enter a name > Create Template.
5. Click on Heading, Text Editor, etc., on the left side.
6-1. For Heading, directly enter `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` in the Title field on the left side, and click on a blank area to exit the editing state, which will trigger XSS once.
6-2. For Text Editor, enter `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` in the Text Page field on the left side, which will trigger XSS once.
Save.
7. Click Preview Changes.
8. The page will trigger XSS.
